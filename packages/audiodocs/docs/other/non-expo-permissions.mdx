# Non-expo app permissions

If your app needs to access non-trivial resources such as microphone or running in the background, there has to be explicit entries about it in special places.

## iOS

On iOS the file that handles special permissions is named [`Info.plist`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list?language=objc).
This file is placed in `ios/YourAppName` directory.
For example to tell system that our app wants to use a microphone, we would need to add this entry to the file.

```
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>App wants to access your microphone in order to use voice memo recording</string>
```

## Android

On Android the file that handles special permissions is named [`AndroidManifest.xml`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro).
This file is placed in `android/app/src/main` directory.
For example to tell system that our app wants to use a microphone, we would need to add this entry to the file.

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```

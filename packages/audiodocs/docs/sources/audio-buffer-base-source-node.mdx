# AudioBufferBaseSourceNode

The `AudioBufferBaseSourceNode` interface is an [`AudioScheduledSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-scheduled-source-node) which aggregates behavior of nodes that requires [`AudioBuffer`](/docs/sources/audio-buffer).

Child classes:
 - [`AudioBufferSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-buffer-source-node)
 - [`AudioBufferQueueSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-buffer-queue-source-node)

## Properties

It inherits all properties from [`AudioScheduledSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-scheduled-source-node#properties).

| Name | Type | Description |
| :----: | :----: | :-------- |
| `detune` | [`AudioParam`](/docs/core/audio-param) | [`k-rate`](/docs/core/audio-param#a-rate-vs-k-rate) `AudioParam` representing detuning of oscillation in cents. |
| `playbackRate` | [`AudioParam`](/docs/core/audio-param) | [`k-rate`](/docs/core/audio-param#a-rate-vs-k-rate) `AudioParam` defining speed factor at which the audio will be played. |

## Methods

It inherits all methods from [`AudioScheduledSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-scheduled-source-node#methods).

### `getLatency`

Returns the playback latency introduced by the pitch correction algorithm, in seconds.
When scheduling precise playback times, start input samples this many seconds earlier to compensate for processing delay.
Typically around `0.06s` when pitch correction is enabled, and `0` otherwise.

#### Returns `number`.

<details>
<summary>Example usage</summary>
```tsx
const source = audioContext.createBufferSource({ pitchCorrection: true });
source.buffer = buffer;
source.connect(audioContext.destination);

const latency = source.getLatency();

// Schedule playback slightly earlier to compensate for latency
const startTime = audioContext.currentTime + 1.0; // play in 1 second
source.start(startTime - latency);
```
</details>


## Events

### `onPositionChanged` <MobileOnly />

Allow to set (or remove) callback that will be fired after processing certain part of an audio.
Frequency is defined by `onPositionChangedInterval`. By setting this callback you can achieve pause functionality.
You can remove callback by passing `null`.

### `onPositionChangedInterval` <MobileOnly />

Allow to set frequency for `onPositionChanged` event. Value that can be set is around `1000/x` Hz.

```ts
import { AudioContext, AudioBufferSourceNode } from 'react-native-audio-api';

function App() {
    const ctx = new AudioContext();
    const sourceNode = ctx.createBufferSource();
    sourceNode.buffer = null; //set your buffer
    let offset = 0;

    sourceNode.onPositionChanged = (event) => { //setting callback
        this.offset = event.value;
    };

    sourceNode.onPositionChangedInterval = 100; //setting frequency to ~10Hz

    sourceNode.start();
}
```

## Remarks

#### `detune`
- Default value is 0.0.
- Nominal range is -∞ to ∞.
- For example value of 100 detune the source up by one semitone, whereas -1200 down by one octave.
- When `createBufferSource(true)` it is clamped to range -1200 to 1200.

#### `playbackRate`
- Default value is 1.0.
- Nominal range is -∞ to ∞.
- For example value of 1.0 plays audio at normal speed, whereas value of 2.0 plays audio twice as fast as normal speed.
- When created with `createBufferSource(true)` it is clamped to range 0 to 3 and uses pitch correction algorithm.
